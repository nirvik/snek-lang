# Snek

Snek is a DSL for distributed systems embedded in Python. The goal is
to allow the building of systems with minimal additional complexity.

Snek programs describe homogeneous distributed systems where each node
has the same program running.

Snek programs are described in terms of components that can
be composed.

Snek attempts to provide a sensible set of communication primitives
which cover the most-used cases for developing distributed systems.

It also provides ways to deal with system failures and recovery.
